## DESCRIPTION

# Challange 1 :
Write a function that accepts a string as input and swaps the case of each character. For example if you input 'The Quick Brown Fox' the output should be 'tHE qUICK bROWN fOX'.

In this challenge we are required to create a function that accepts a string as input and swaps the case of each character of the string in that when the first character is an uppercase letter it changes the case of the first character to lowercase then the rest of the string is replaced with uppercase letters ie; if the string is 'The Quick Brown Fox' it should return 'tHE qUICK bROWN fOX

# Challange 2 : 
 Write a JavaScript function that accepts two numbers to generate an array between them. For example, if the two numbers are 4 and 7, the output should be [4, 5, 6, 7] and -4 and 7 should return [-4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]. 

 In this challenge we are required to create a function that accepts two numbers and returns an array of numbers that are between the said first and second numbers ie if the numbers are 4, 7 the JavaScript function should return [4, 5, 6, 7] and if the numbers are -4 and 7 it should return [-4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]

 # Challange 3 : 
 You are tasked with writing a function that takes an array of numbers as input and returns a new array containing only the prime numbers from the original array. How would you implement this function efficiently, ensuring that it accurately identifies prime numbers and returns them in the same order they appear in the input array? For example if you provide an array [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10] it should return an array [2, 3, 5, 7].

 In this challange we created a function called isPrime that taeks an array of numbers [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10] and returns a new array that only contains the prime numbers from the original array and each prime number is in the same order as they are in the original array. So if we have the array stated above the function should iterate over the array of numbers and distinguish either if the number is prime or not. It should then return an array of prime numbers [2, 3, 5, 7]
